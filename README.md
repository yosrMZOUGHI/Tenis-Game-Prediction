# Tennis-Game-Prediction


We used Logistic Regression to predict either a player wins ( predict 1) or loses ( predict 2) in a Tennis game.  

# Required 
Python3, pandas, scikit-Learn

# Good to know
1. We tried many features combinations ( using the data in ./data folder), but, kept the most relevant ones. It is still possible to explore new features to improve the model. 

2. The "result.csv" file contains the output obtained from "test.csv".
